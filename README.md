# Description
This repository is a template for a multi-class c++ smart contract intended to be build with clsdk (rather than the eosio.cdt).

# How to use
By far the easiest way to make use of ths template is to use the [vscode-new-eos-contract](https://github.com/EOSPowerNetwork/vscode-new-eos-contract) repo, which will automatically download this smart contract template into an environment preconfigured to be capable of building it with clsdk.
